## Executive Summary

FundRoom Sign is FundRoom's **native, zero-external-cost** e-signature platform purpose-built for fund operations. Unlike generic e-signature tools (DocuSign, PandaDoc), FundRoom Sign deeply integrates with the investor lifecycle — auto-filling subscription agreements from investor profiles, enforcing SEC compliance fields, and feeding signed documents directly into the investor vault.

This spec outlines the evolution from the current MVP (functional but basic e-signature for LP onboarding) to a full-featured e-signature platform that can:

1. **Replace DocuSign/PandaDoc** for fund managers (zero per-envelope cost)
2. **Serve as a standalone product** for non-fund document signing
3. **Power a Secure Document Vault** for investor records, external partners, and compliance archival
4. **Offer API access** for third-party integrations and white-label embedding

**Key differentiators over DocuSign/PandaDoc:**
- Zero per-envelope cost (native, not API-based)
- Deep SEC compliance integration (accreditation fields, Form D auto-fill, audit trails)
- Investor profile auto-fill (entity details, addresses, tax IDs flow into documents)
- Fund-specific document types (subscription agreements, side letters, K-1s, capital call notices)
- Integrated investor vault (signed documents automatically stored in LP's secure vault)
- White-label ready (GP branding on signing experience)

---

## Vision & Strategy

### Phase 2: Full E-Signature Platform

#### 2.1 Drag-and-Drop Field Placement Editor

**The single most important missing feature.** Currently, signature fields are placed programmatically (via seed data or API). GPs need a visual editor to place fields on any PDF.

**UI/UX:**
```

```

**Technical approach:**
- PDF rendered via react-pdf at actual resolution
- Fields placed as absolute-positioned divs over the PDF canvas
- Drag-and-drop using HTML5 Drag API (same pattern as LP Onboarding step reorder)
- Field positions stored as percentages (x, y, width, height) — already in schema
- Each field assigned to a signer (color-coded by signer)
- Resize handles on fields (min size enforced for touch targets)
- Page navigation with field count per page
- Snap-to-grid optional alignment

**Key files to create:**
- `components/esign/field-placement-editor.tsx` — Main editor component
- `components/esign/draggable-field.tsx` — Individual draggable field
- `components/esign/signer-manager.tsx` — Add/remove/reorder signers
- `components/esign/document-prepare-page.tsx` — Full page with editor + settings

#### 2.2 Bulk Send with Mail Merge

Send the same document to multiple recipients with personalized field values.

**Flow:**
```
GP uploads PDF → Places fields → "Bulk Send" →
Select recipients (from CRM contacts / investor list / CSV) →
Map merge fields to recipient data →
Preview per-recipient → Confirm → Send all
```

**Merge fields:**
- `{{investor_name}}` — Full name from profile
- `{{investor_entity}}` — Entity name
- `{{investment_amount}}` — Commitment amount
- `{{fund_name}}` — Fund name
- `{{gp_entity}}` — GP organization name
- `{{date}}` — Current date
- `{{commitment_units}}` — Number of units
- `{{investor_address}}` — Full address
- `{{investor_email}}` — Email
- `{{investor_ssn_last4}}` — Last 4 of SSN (masked)
- `{{custom_field_N}}` — Custom fields from CSV

**Technical:**
- Each bulk send creates N individual `SignatureDocument` records
- Shared `SignatureTemplate` reference for audit
- Status tracking per recipient (pending/sent/viewed/signed)
- Batch email via Resend (tier 2, org-branded)
- Dashboard showing bulk send progress

#### 2.3 Enhanced Template Library

**Current state:** `SignatureTemplate` model exists with CRUD APIs. The `DocumentTemplateManager` component provides management UI.

**Phase 2 enhancements:**
- **Template categories:** NDA, Subscription Agreement, LPA, Side Letter, SAFE, Convertible Note, Board Consent, Custom
- **FundRoom-provided templates:** Pre-built templates for common fund documents with best-practice field placement
- **Template marketplace:** GPs can share templates (Phase 3)
- **Template versioning:** Track changes across template updates
- **Smart defaults by fund type:** When creating a new template, auto-suggest field placements based on document type

#### 2.4 Signing Reminders & Expiration

**Current state:** `lastReminderSentAt` and `reminderCount` fields exist on `SignatureRecipient`. No automated scheduler.

**Phase 2:**
- Cron job (daily) checks for unsigned documents past reminder threshold
- Configurable reminder schedule: 3 days, 7 days, 14 days (default)
- Maximum reminder count: configurable per org (default 3)
- Expiration: auto-void document after configurable period (30/60/90 days)
- Reminder email template (tier 2, org-branded)
- GP dashboard: "Awaiting Signature" queue with manual "Send Reminder" button

#### 2.5 Document Analytics

Track how recipients interact with documents before signing.

| Metric | Description | Implementation |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| View time | Total time document was open | SignatureAuditLog `actionDuration` |
| Page dwell | Time per page | SignatureAuditLog `pageNumber` + duration |
| Completion rate | % of recipients who sign vs total sent | Aggregate from SignatureRecipient |
| Time to sign | Duration from sent to signed | `sentAt` vs `signedAt` |
| Decline rate | % of recipients who decline | SignatureRecipientStatus counts |
| Device breakdown | Desktop vs mobile vs tablet | SignatureAuditLog `device` |

#### 2.6 External Signer Support

Allow sending documents to anyone (not just LPs/team members).

**Current state:** Token-based signing already works without authentication. The gap is a **send flow** for GPs to initiate signing with external parties.

**Phase 2 flow:**
```
GP opens "New Document" → Uploads PDF → Places fields →
Adds signers: "External" tab →
  Name + Email (required)
  Access code (optional, for extra security)
  Signing order (sequential or parallel)
→ Send →
  Email with signing link → Recipient opens link →
  Token-based signing (no account needed) →
  Completed document stored in GP's vault
```

### Phase 3: DocuSign Competitor Features

#### 3.1 Standalone Signing (No Fund Required)

Remove the fund/investor dependency. Any FundRoom user can send any document for signature.

**Use cases:**
- Employment agreements
- Vendor contracts
- Client engagement letters
- Board resolutions
- Consulting agreements

#### 3.2 Workflow Automation

Conditional routing based on document content or signer actions.

```
IF signer.role === "APPROVER" AND action === "APPROVED"
  THEN route to next signer in sequence
ELSE IF action === "DECLINED"
  THEN notify sender + void remaining
ELSE IF field.value("investment_amount") > 1000000
  THEN add "Compliance Review" step before final execution
```

#### 3.3 Payment Collection on Signature

Integrate Stripe checkout into the signing flow. LP signs subscription agreement → immediately prompted to wire or pay.

#### 3.4 Notarization Integration

Partner with remote online notarization (RON) providers:
- Notarize.com
- Pavaso
- DocVerify

For documents requiring notarization (real estate closings, certain state filings).

#### 3.5 White-Label / Embed SDK

```javascript
// Third-party embed example
import { FundRoomSign } from '@fundroom/sign-sdk';

const signer = new FundRoomSign({
  apiKey: 'sk_live_...',
  branding: {
    logo: 'https://acmecapital.com/logo.png',
    primaryColor: '#1a365d',
  },
});

// Create and embed signing session
const session = await signer.createSession({
  documentUrl: 'https://storage.example.com/contract.pdf',
  signers: [
    { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com', role: 'SIGNER' },
  ],
  fields: [
    { type: 'SIGNATURE', page: 1, x: 0.1, y: 0.85, width: 0.3, height: 0.05 },
    { type: 'DATE_SIGNED', page: 1, x: 0.5, y: 0.85, width: 0.2, height: 0.03 },
  ],
  webhooks: {
    onComplete: 'https://myapp.com/api/signing-complete',
    onDecline: 'https://myapp.com/api/signing-declined',
  },
});

// Embed in iframe
document.getElementById('sign-container').innerHTML =
  `<iframe src="${session.signingUrl}" />`;
```

#### 3.6 Advanced Compliance

| Compliance | Phase | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| ESIGN Act | ✅ MVP | Consent modal, audit trail |
| UETA | ✅ MVP | Attribution, effect, record |
| SEC 506(c) | ✅ MVP | Immutable hash-chained audit log |
| eIDAS (EU) | Phase 3 | For EU fund operations |
| HIPAA BAA | Phase 3 | Healthcare fund compliance |
| SOC 2 Type II | Phase 3 | Enterprise security certification |
| 21 CFR Part 11 | Phase 3 | FDA-regulated documents |

## Part 2: Secure Document Vault

### Investor Document Vault (Current)

The LP Document Vault is production-ready in the current MVP.

#### Current Capabilities

```
SUBSCRIPTION_AGREEMENT
NDA
ACCREDITATION_PROOF
TAX_DOCUMENT
IDENTITY_VERIFICATION
WIRE_PROOF
SIDE_LETTER
OPERATING_AGREEMENT
FINANCIAL_STATEMENT
OTHER
```

### External Partner Vault

**Phase 2 — New capability for non-LP users.**

A secure document vault accessible to external partners (lawyers, accountants, co-GPs, advisors) without requiring fund investment.

#### Use Cases

| User | Documents | Access Level |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Fund counsel | LPA drafts, opinion letters, regulatory filings | Read/write for fund docs |
| Auditors | Financial statements, tax returns, K-1 packages | Read-only for compliance docs |
| Co-GPs | Operating agreements, management company docs | Full access to co-GP folder |
| Placement agents | Marketing materials, DDQ, track record | Read-only + watermarked |
| Board advisors | Board minutes, resolutions, quarterly reports | Read-only per meeting |

#### Access Model

```
External Partner Vault Access:
  1. GP invites partner via email
  2. Partner receives OTP (6-digit code) — no account needed
  3. Partner enters OTP → vault opens
  4. Access scoped to specific folder(s) only
  5. All views logged in audit trail
  6. Session expires after configurable timeout (default 4 hours)
  7. Re-authentication required for each session
```

**This aligns with the user's directive:** "by default, the dataroom you do not need to sign NDA, and you should be able to access the Dataroom with just an approved email, and a verified magic link or a 6 digit code emailed to you when you try to get in. No ACCOUNT needed."

#### Partner Vault Schema (Phase 2)

```prisma
model VaultPartner {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  teamId    String
  team      Team     @relation(fields: [teamId], references: [id])

  ADVISOR
  OTHER
}

enum VaultAccessLevel {

GP can request specific documents from LPs/partners:

```
GP creates "Document Request" →
  Document type (Accreditation Proof, Financial Statement, etc.)
  Due date
  Instructions
  Recipient(s)
→ Email sent with upload link →
LP/partner uploads document →
GP reviews → Approve/Request Revision
```

#### 2.5 Bulk K-1 Distribution

Annual K-1 tax document distribution flow:

```
GP uploads K-1 PDFs (bulk) →
  Auto-match to investors by name/SSN-last-4 →
  Review matching → Confirm →
  Send K-1 notification emails →
  Each LP sees K-1 in their vault →
  Track: viewed, downloaded, acknowledged
```

## Part 4: Technical Architecture

### Data Models

The e-signature system uses 6 core models (already in schema) plus 2 proposed additions:

#### Existing Models

```
SignatureDocument (30+ fields)
  → SignatureRecipient[] (per-signer tracking)
    → SignatureField[] (per-field values)
  → SignatureAuditLog[] (per-action audit)

SignatureTemplate (15+ fields)
  → Reusable document templates

EsigUsageRecord (per-team monthly counters)
EsigUsage (per-org monthly counters)

LPDocument (30+ fields)
  → LPDocumentReview[] (review history)
```

#### Proposed Additions (Phase 2)

```prisma
// Signing reminder schedule
model SigningReminder {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  documentId    String
  recipientId   String
  scheduledAt   DateTime
  sentAt        DateTime?
  reminderType  ReminderType // FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, FINAL, EXPIRATION_WARNING

  @@index([scheduledAt])
  @@index([documentId])
}

// Bulk send batch tracking
model BulkSigningBatch {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  teamId      String
  templateId  String?

  title       String
  totalCount  Int
  sentCount   Int @default(0)
  signedCount Int @default(0)

  status      BulkBatchStatus // PREPARING, SENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED

  // Merge field mapping
  mergeFieldMap Json? // { "investor_name": "column_A", ... }

  documents SignatureDocument[]

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt

  @@index([teamId])
  @@index([status])
}
```

### Storage Architecture

```
Document Storage (multi-provider):
  ├── S3 + CloudFront (primary, KMS-encrypted, per-org prefixes)
  │   └── {teamId}/{docId}/{filename}
  ├── Vercel Blob (fallback)
  └── Replit Object Storage (dev)

Encryption layers:
  1. Storage-level: S3 SSE-KMS or Vercel Blob encryption
  2. Application-level: AES-256 for sensitive fields (tax IDs, SSNs)
  3. Client-side: Optional client-side encryption (LPDocument.isClientEncrypted)
  4. Transport: HTTPS + HSTS (max-age=63072000)

Signed PDF pipeline:
  PDF uploaded → fields placed → sent to signers →
  signatures captured → pdf-lib flattens signatures onto pages →
  Certificate of Completion appended →
  AES-256 encrypted → stored in vault →
  signedFileUrl + signedAt updated on SignatureDocument
```

### Security & Encryption

| Layer | Technology | Implementation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Token-based signing | 64-char hex token | `SignatureRecipient.signingToken` (unique) |
| Access codes | 6-digit numeric | Optional per-recipient, bcrypt hashed |
| ESIGN consent | JSON record | IP, timestamp, consent text version, user-agent |
| SHA-256 checksums | Per-document | Document hash at signing time for tamper detection |
| Immutable audit | Hash-chained log | `AuditLog` with `previousHash` → `currentHash` chain |
| Rate limiting | Tiered | GET: 30/min, POST: 10/min on signing endpoints |
| Anomaly detection | `lib/security/anomaly-detection.ts` | IP-based suspicious activity detection |

### API Design

| POST | `/api/vault/partners/[id]/verify` | Public | Verify OTP + start session |
| GET | `/api/vault/[partnerId]/documents` | Partner token | List accessible documents |

#### Webhook Events (Phase 2)

```json
{
  "event": "document.completed",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-20T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "documentId": "clxyz...",
    "title": "Subscription Agreement",
    "completedAt": "2026-02-20T10:30:00Z",
    "signers": [
      {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "email": "jane@example.com",
        "signedAt": "2026-02-20T10:28:00Z"
      }
    ],
    "signedPdfUrl": "https://..."
  }
}
```

Events:
- `document.sent` — Document sent to first/next signer
- `document.viewed` — Signer opened the document
- `document.signed` — A signer completed their fields
- `document.completed` — All signers completed
- `document.declined` — A signer declined
- `document.voided` — Sender voided the document
- `document.expired` — Document expired without completion
- `document.reminder_sent` — Reminder email sent

## Part 5: Competitive Analysis

### FundRoom Sign vs DocuSign vs PandaDoc

| Feature | FundRoom Sign (Phase 2) | DocuSign | PandaDoc |
|---------|------------------------|----------|----------|
| **Cost per envelope** | $0 (native) | $0.50-2.00+ | $0.50-1.50+ |
| **Fund document types** | Built-in (Sub Ag, LPA, SAFE, K-1) | Generic | Generic |
| **Investor auto-fill** | Deep (entity, accreditation, tax ID) | Basic (name, email) | Basic |
| **SEC compliance fields** | Native (506(b)/506(c) audit trail) | None | None |
| **Accreditation verification** | Integrated | None | None |
| **Investor vault** | Integrated (auto-store signed docs) | Separate product | None |
| **CRM integration** | Native (FundRoom CRM) | Salesforce, HubSpot | Native CRM |
| **Payment collection** | Wire + ACH (Phase 2) | DocuSign Payments | Built-in |
| **Template marketplace** | Phase 3 | DocuSign Marketplace | PandaDoc Templates |
| **API** | Phase 2 | Mature | Mature |
| **White-label** | Phase 3 | Enterprise only | Not available |
| **Mobile signing** | Optimized (touch, iOS zoom prevention) | Good | Good |
| **Bulk send** | Phase 2 | Yes | Yes |
| **Drag-drop editor** | Phase 2 | Yes | Yes (advanced) |
| **Offline/notarization** | Phase 3 | DocuSign Notary | None |

### Key Competitive Advantages

1. **Zero per-envelope cost:** DocuSign charges $0.50-2.00+ per envelope depending on plan. FundRoom Sign is native — unlimited envelopes at no marginal cost. For a GP sending 100+ subscription agreements, this saves $50-200+ per fund raise.

2. **Deep investor data integration:** DocuSign treats every signer as a blank slate. FundRoom Sign auto-fills from the investor profile — entity name, address, tax ID, commitment amount, accreditation status all pre-populated. LPs sign faster, GPs get fewer errors.

3. **SEC compliance built-in:** No other e-signature platform understands Regulation D. FundRoom Sign enforces 506(c) accreditation fields, captures Form D data, and maintains immutable audit trails. Compliance is automatic, not manual.

4. **Investor vault integration:** Signed documents flow directly into the LP's vault. No manual downloading from DocuSign and re-uploading to a fund admin system. GPs see signing status on their dashboard. LPs see documents in their portal.

5. **Fund-specific document intelligence:** The system knows what a Subscription Agreement is, what a Side Letter is, what a K-1 is. It can auto-suggest field placements, enforce required fields per document type, and track document completion as part of the investor lifecycle (not just a generic signing event).
